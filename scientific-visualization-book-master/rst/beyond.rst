Graphic library
===============

Beyond its usage for scientific visualization, matplotlib is also *a
comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive
visualizations in Python* as written on the `website
<https://matplotlib.org/>`__. Said differently, matplotlib is a
graphic library that can be used for virtually any purpose, even
though the performance may vary greatly from one application to the
other, depending on the complexity of the rendering. Such versatility
can be explained by the presence of a number of low-level objects,
that allow to produce virtually any rendering, and supported by a
number of standard operations as shown on figure
:ref:`figure-polygon-clipping`

   Polygon clipping

   (sources: :source:`beyond/polygon-clipping.py`).

Here is a first example showing the capability of matplotlib in terms
of polygon and clipping. As you can see on figure
:ref:`figure-polygon-clipping`, clipping allows to render any
combination of two polygons.

Such clipping can be used as well in a regular figure to make some
interesting effect as shown on figure :ref:`figure-interactive-loupe`.

Matplotlib dungeon
------------------

If you ever played role playing game (especially Dungeons & Dragons),
you may have encountered "Dyson hatching" as shown on figure
:ref:`figure-matplotlib-dungeon` (look at the outside border of
the walls). This kind of hatching is quite unique and immediately
identifies the plan as some kind of dungeon. This hatching has been
originally designed by `Dyson Logos <https://dysonlogos.blog/>`__ who
was kind enough to explain `how he draws it (by hand)
<https://dysonlogos.blog/2011/09/03/dungeon-doodles-a-crosshatching-tutorial/>`__. Question is then, how to reproduce it using matplotlib?

It's actually not too difficult but it's not totally straightforward
either because we have to take care of several details to get a nice
result. The starting point is a random two-dimensional distribution
where points needs to be not too close to each other. To achieve such
result, can use Bridsonâ€™s Algorithm which is a very popular method to
produce such blue noise sample point distributions that guarantees
that no two points are closer than a given distance. If you observe
figure :ref:`figure-bluenoise`, you can see the algorithm makes a real
difference when compared to either a pure uniform distribution or a
regular grid with some normal jitters.

   :width: 100%

   Uniform distribution, jittered grid and blue noise distribution
   :label:`figure-bluenoise`
   (sources: :source:`beyond/bluenoise.py`).

From this blue noise distribution, we can insert hatch pattern at each
location with a random orientation. A hatch pattern is a set of
n parallel lines with some noise:

.. code:: python

   def hatch(n=4, theta=None):
       theta = theta or np.random.uniform(0,np.pi)
       P = np.zeros((n,2,2))
       X = np.linspace(-0.5,+0.5,n,endpoint=True)
       P[:,0,1] = -0.5 + np.random.normal(0, 0.05, n)
       P[:,1,1] = +0.5 + np.random.normal(0, 0.05, n)
       P[:,1,0] = X + np.random.normal(0, 0.025, n)
       P[:,0,0] = X + np.random.normal(0, 0.025, n)
       c, s = np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta)
       Z = np.array([[ c, s],[-s, c]])
       return P @ Z.T

You can see the result in the center of figure
:ref:`figure-dyson-hatching`. This starts to look like Dyson hatching
but it is not yet satisfactory because hatches cover each others. To
avoid that, we need to clip hatches using the corresponding voronoi
cells. The easiest way to do that is to use the `shapely library
<https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely>`__ that provides methods to
compute intersection with generic polygons. You can see the result on
the right part of figure :ref:`figure-dyson-hatching` and it looks
much nicer (in my honest opinion).

We are not done yet. Next part is to generate a dungeon. If you search
for dungeon generator on the internet, you'll find many generators,
from the most basic ones to the much more complex. In my case, I
simply designed the dungeon using inkscape and I extracted the
coordinates of the walls from the svg file:

.. code:: python
          
   Walls = np.array([
       [1,1],[5,1],[5,3],[8,3],[8,2],[11,2],[11,5],[10,5],
       [10,6],[12,6],[12,8],[13,8],[13,10],[11,10],[11,12],
       [2,12],[2,10],[1,10],[1,7],[4,7],[4,10],[3,10],
       [3,11],[10,11],[10,10],[9,10],[9,8],[11,8],[11,7],
       [9,7],[9,5],[8,5],[8,4],[5,4],[5,6],[1,6], [1,1]])
   walls = Polygon(Walls, closed=True, zorder=10,
                   facecolor="white", edgecolor="None",
                   lw=3, joinstyle="round")
   ax.add_patch(walls)

The next step is to restrict the hatching to the vicinity of the
walls. Since hatches corresponds to our initial point distribution, it
is only a matter of filtering hatches whose centers are sufficiently
close to any wall. It thus only requires to compute the distance of a
point to a line segment. At this point, we do not care it the the
hatch is inside or outside the dungeon since the internal hatches are
hidden by the interior of the dungeon (see zorder above). I proceeded
by adding dotted squares inside corridors using a collection of
vertical and horizontal lines as well as some random "rocks" which are
actually collection of small ellipses. Last, I added a nice title
using an old looking font. I used `Morris Roman
<https://www.dafont.com/fr/morris-roman.font>`__ font by Dieter
Steffmann.

The result looks nice but it can be further improved. For example, we
could introduce some noise in walls to suggest manual drawing, we
could improve rocks by adding noise, etc. Matplotlib provides
everything that is needed and the only limit is your imagination. If
you're curious on what could be achieved, make sure to have a look at
`one page dungeon <https://watabou.itch.io/one-page-dungeon>`__ by
Oleg Dolya or the `Fantasy map generator
<https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/>`__ by Martin O'Leary.

Tiny bot simulator
------------------

Using the same approach, it is possible to design a tiny bot simulator
as shown on figure :ref:`figure-tinybot` which is a snapshot of the
simulation. To design this simulator, I started by splitting the figure
using gridspec as follows:

.. code:: python

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,5), frameon=False)
    G = GridSpec(8, 2, width_ratios=(1,2))
    ax = plt.subplot( G[:,0], aspect=1, frameon=False)
    ...
    
    for i in range(8): # 8 sensors
        sax = plt.subplot( G[i,1])
        ...

`ax` is the axes on the left showing the maze and the bot while sax
are axes to display sensors value on the right. Maze walls are
rendered using a line collection while the robot is rendered using a
circle (for the body), a line (for the "head", i.e. a line indicating
direction) and a line collection for the sensors. The overall
simulation is a matplotlib animation where the update function is
responsible for updating the bot position and sensors values.

.. figure:: beyond/tinybot.pdf
   :width: 100%

   :label:`figure-tinybot`
   (sources: :source:`beyond/tinybot.py`).

There is no real difficulty but the computation of sensors & wall
intersection which can be vectorized using Numpy to make it fast:

.. code:: python

   def line_intersect(p1, p2, P3, P4):

       p1 = np.atleast_2d(p1)
       p2 = np.atleast_2d(p2)
       P3 = np.atleast_2d(P3)
       P4 = np.atleast_2d(P4)

       x1, y1 = p1[:,0], p1[:,1]
       x2, y2 = p2[:,0], p2[:,1]
       X3, Y3 = P3[:,0], P3[:,1]
       X4, Y4 = P4[:,0], P4[:,1]

       D = (Y4-Y3)*(x2-x1) - (X4-X3)*(y2-y1)

       # Colinearity test
       C = (D != 0)
       UA = ((X4-X3)*(y1-Y3) - (Y4-Y3)*(x1-X3))
       UA = np.divide(UA, D, where=C)
       UB = ((x2-x1)*(y1-Y3) - (y2-y1)*(x1-X3))
       UB = np.divide(UB, D, where=C)

       # Test if intersections are inside each segment
       C = C * (UA > 0) * (UA < 1) * (UB > 0) * (UB < 1)

       X = np.where(C, x1 + UA*(x2-x1), np.inf)
       Y = np.where(C, y1 + UA*(y2-y1), np.inf)
       return np.stack([X,Y],axis=1)

This simulator could be easily extended with a camera showing the
environment in 3D using the renderer I introduced in chapter
`chap-3D`_. In the end, it is possible to write a complete simulator
in a few lines of Python. The goal is of course not to replace a real
simulator, but it comes handy to rapidly prototype an idea which is
exactly what I did to study decision making using the reservoir
computing paradigm.


Real example
------------

When put together, these graphical primitives allow to draw quite
elaborated figures as shown on figure
:ref:`figure-basal-ganglia`. This figure comes from the article `A
graphical, scalable and intuitive method for the placement and the
connection of biological cells
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05189.pdf>`_ that introduces a graphical
method originating from the computer graphics domain that is used for
the arbitrary placement of cells over a two-dimensional manifold. The
figure represents a schematic slice of the basal ganglia (striatum and
globus pallidus) that has been split in four different subfigures:

* **Subfigure A** is made of a bitmap image showing an arbitrary
  density of neurons. I used a bitmap image because it is not yet
  possible to render such arbitrary gradient using
  matplotlib. However, I also read the corresponding SVG image to
  extract the paths delimiting each structure and plot them on the
  figure.

* **Subfigure B** represents the actual method for positioning an
  arbitrary number of neurons enforcing the density represented by the
  color gradient. To represent them, I used a simple scatter plot and
  colored some neurons according to their input/output status.

* **Subfigure C** represents an interpolation of the activity of the
  neurons and has been made using a 2D histogram mode. To do that, I
  simply built a big array representing the whole image and I set the
  activity around the neuron using a disc of constant radius. This is
  only a matter of translating the 2d coordinates of the neuron to a
  2D index inside the image array. I then used an `imshow` to show the
  result and I drew over the frontiers of each structure. This kind of
  rendering helps to see the overall activity inside the structure.

* **Subfigure D** is probably the most complex because it involved the
  computation of Voronoi cells and their intersection with the border
  of the structure. Once again, the shapely library is incredibly
  useful to achieve such result. Once the cell have been computed, it
  is only a matter of painting them with a colormap according to their
  activity. For efficiency, this is made using a poly collection.

This is actually quite a complex example, but once you've written the
code, it can be adapted to any input (the SVG file in this case) such
that your final result is fully automated. Of course, the amount of
work this represents should be balanced with your actual needs. If you
need the figure only once, it is probably not worth the effort if you
can do it manually.

**Stamp like effect** `Fancy boxes <https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/shapes_and_collections/fancybox_demo.html>`_ offer several style that can be used to achieve different effect as shown on figure :ref:`figure-mona-lisa-stamp`. The goal is to achieve the same effect.

**Radial Maze** Try to redo the figure :ref:`figure-radial-maze` which
displays a radial maze (that is used quite often in neuroscience to
study mouse or rat behavior) and a simulated path representing a rat
exploring the maze (this has been generated by recording the
(computer) mouse movements). The color of each block represents the
occupancy rate, that is, the number of recorded point inside the
block.
