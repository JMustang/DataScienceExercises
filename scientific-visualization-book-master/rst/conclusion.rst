You've now reached the end of this book that took me nearly two years
to write, mostly due to the pandemic that slowed down things quite a
bit. I'm not totally satisfied with the result because there is a
lot of features I wanted to introduce but I've never found the time to
do so and the book had to be released at some point. This will be
included in the second edition, depending how the first edition is
perceived by the community.

In any case, I hope you'll find the book useful for your own work and
spread the word if you like it. If you want to support my work, you
can buy a printed edition on Amazon.
