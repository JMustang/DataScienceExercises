External resources
==================

One of the strength of matplotlib is the extensive documentation available from
the website. But there is also a large set of external resources that are
incredibly useful when you're looking to design a specific figure:

* The matplotlib documentation is the primary source of information whenever
  you need to know the parameters of this or that function. It has also a very
  well written set of tutorials that are worth to be read:

  - The `starter guide <https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/usage.html>`_ helps you to get started with Matplotlib   
  - The `pyplot tutorial <https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html>`_ is an introduction to the `pyplot` interface
  - The `image tutorial <https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/images.html>`_ explains the basic of image display
  - The `catalogue <https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots.html>`_ shows some neat and standard visualizations
  - The `frequently asked questions <https://matplotlib.org/faq/index.html>`__ are worth a read


* Online help is available from two mailing lists (users and
  developers) and from stack overflow which has a dedicated matplotlib
  tag and a lot of questions have been asked and answered:

   - The `matplotlib users mailing list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users>`_ 
   - The `matplotlib developers mailing lists <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel>`_
   - `Stack overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib>`__ (more than 40,000 questions related to matplotlib)


* There exist various galleries online among which the matplotlib gallery that
  is probably the best gallery to start with. The other galleries are worth a
  look because they explain the rationale for each kind of plot:

  - The `Matplotlib Gallery`_ is probably the best resource if you're looking
    for how to do a specific figure. Just search for the closest example and
    get the code.
  - The `Data Visualization Catalogue`_ is a project developed by Severino
    Ribecca to create a library of different information visualisation types.
  - The `Python Graph gallery`_ displays hundreds of charts and aims to
    showcase the awesome dataviz possibilities of Python.
  - The `R Graph Gallery`_ is a collection of charts made displayed in several
    sections, always with their (R) reproducible code available.
    
* Finally, there exists many books about matplotlib and data visualization. I
  selected only a few of them that are well written and open access. You can
  find them in the :nameref:`chap-bibliography` appendix.
