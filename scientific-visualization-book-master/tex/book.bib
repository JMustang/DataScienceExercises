                  you a better typographer. I’m not here to tell you that
                  typography is more important than the substance of your
                  writing. It’s not. But typography can enhance your writing.
                  Typography can create a better first impression. Typography
                  can reinforce your key points. Typography can extend reader
                  attention.},
